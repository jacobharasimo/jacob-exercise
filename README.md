# Getro FE coding skills exercise.

## Introduction and objectives.
This repo is a prototype that our design team
together with the product team have agreed on its implementation.

You will find that the code has been written really fast, it doesn't even communicate with
our backend. 

## Must have

What we expect from you as a FE lead/architect is:

* Code Style: You propose a set of tools/configurations that ensure that the code style followed by all 
the team members keeps stable.

* Test infrastructure: We don't expect that you write tests for all the components.
Tests for one component should be enough.

* Code refactoring: Do as many refactors as you think are convenient before your team members start working
with the project so you ensure that they will find a stable and solid codebase.

## Nice to have.

These topics are as important as the previous one but we assume that it's hard to build a solution with them in just two
hours. Try to do your best, simply take some notes on your proposed solution. We will discuss them during the code
review.

* CI/CD integration. There is no need to be extremely accurate since it won't deploy in real 
life. Just propose how would you setup the pipeline. Clue: We rely on github + Circle CI.

* State management: Managing the state in a front-end application is challenging. Propose a solution to manage 
the application state. 


## Tools required to do the exercise.

We give absolute freedom to our developers in order to setup their environments so feel free
to use whatever IDE/editor makes you more productive. Also, if you consider that a library should be 
included go ahead. We'll discuss it later during the code review.

## Duration of the exercise.

We value your time. We don't expect from you to invest more than 2 hours on it. If you need more time
just take notes and we will discuss your ideas during the code review.

## How to do this exercise.
Clone the repo in your github account, then create a PR against our repo so we will be 
able to see your proposed solution.

Finally, don't forget to email us once you've created the PR. We'll arrange the code review meeting after.

Good luck!
